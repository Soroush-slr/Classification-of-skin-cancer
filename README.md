# Classification-of-skin-cancer

ðŸ”´Improving classification accuracy using Data Augmentation and EfficientNet-Based Model (Dataset: ðŸ“Š Skin Cancer)

In this project, we classified the SentiPers dataset with the help of different classification methods. With the help of this dataset (https://github.com/phosseini/SentiPers/blob/master/data/sentipers.xlsx), the groups should implement different classification systems (which include cleaning steps, pre-processing, classification model training, etc.).

Cleaning and preprocessing of texts
Along with techniques such as Tokenization and removing Stopwords, among other methods that can be used at this stage, we can mention Stemming, Lemmatization and Normalization.
