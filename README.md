# Classification-of-skin-cancer

ðŸ”´Improving classification accuracy using Data Augmentation and EfficientNet-Based Model (Dataset: ðŸ“Š Skin Cancer)

In this project, we classified the SentiPers dataset with the help of different classification methods. With the help of this dataset (https://github.com/phosseini/SentiPers/blob/master/data/sentipers.xlsx), the groups should implement different classification systems (which include cleaning steps, pre-processing, classification model training, etc.).
