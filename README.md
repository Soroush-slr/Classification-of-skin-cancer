# Classification-of-skin-cancer

ðŸ”´Improving classification accuracy using Data Augmentation and EfficientNet-Based Model (Dataset: ðŸ“Š Skin Cancer)

In this project, we classified the SentiPers dataset with the help of different classification methods. With the help of this dataset (https://github.com/phosseini/SentiPers/blob/master/data/sentipers.xlsx), the groups should implement different classification systems (which include cleaning steps, pre-processing, classification model training, etc.).

Cleaning and preprocessing of texts:

- Along with techniques such as Tokenization and removing Stopwords, among other methods that can be used at this stage, we can mention Stemming, Lemmatization and Normalization.

Multi-class Classification Models:

After cleaning and preprocessing the texts and dividing the entire dataset with a ratio of 60% - 20% - 20% into three subgroups.
Train, Validation (Development), Test, implement the following category models. Since each data record, based on the sense of the text, has one of Polarity 2, 1, 0, 1- and 2-, finally these models are trained in one of the following ways in order to categorize the data.
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
